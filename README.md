Dynamic Music Player

## Inspiration

I wanted to build something simple yet useful with only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Music connects everyone, and a music player felt like a good project to learn about interactivity and design.

## What it does

Plays, pauses,Shuffles and switches between songs

Shows song title, artist, and cover image

Displays a progress bar with current and total time

allow the users to add the songs 

volume control

playlists and shuffle option

volume control

dark and light themes


Works smoothly on mobile, tablet, and desktop

Uses clean design and animations to make it engaging

## How we built it

HTML for the structure

CSS for styling and responsive design

JavaScript for all the controls and dynamic updates

## Challenges we ran into

Syncing the progress bar with the actual song time

Making the design responsive for all screens

Updating song details dynamically without breaking the flow

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Built a fully working music player without frameworks

just made a very interactive User Interface designing

Made it responsive and simple to use

Learned how to handle audio controls with JavaScript

## What we learned

DOM manipulation in JavaScript

Building responsive layouts with CSS

Designing interactive UI with minimal code

## What's next


Make it installable as a web app

## PS to fellow builders
 
Frameworks are not mandatory to build dynamic,responsive and asthetic websites...

Go,   Try,..
